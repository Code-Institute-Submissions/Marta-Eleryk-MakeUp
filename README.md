<h1>Marta Eleryk Makeup</h1>

This website is desinged for a friend of mine who has started her own makeup business and needed a website
to showcase her work. It includes her portfolio. a contact page a section with her bio.


<h1>UX</h1>

After talks with the makeup artist we decided that the website should look as clean as possible so we went for 
white background with black text and kept this theme running througout the website.  I think it lets the images do the talking
which is the main focus for a makeup artist who wants to showcase their work. The images have been grouped into different sections on the portfolio
and main page, the images used for these groups were chosen to try and keep a similar colour between them giving a better visual user experience.

<h1>Features</h1>

    Heading - allows users to know what the site is about, by giving them the artists logo and the business.
    Logo - Shows the artists main logo and shrinks down to anothjer logo on smaller screens.
    Navbar - allows userds to navigate the site by giving them a menu with links to the different pages.
    images - shows the user all of the artists work and provides the main focuse for each page.
    about section -  shows the user the artists history and what they're all about.
    contact page - provides a form to fill out for contacting and booking the artist.
    social links - lets the user see the artists instagram and an email link for the artists outlook messenger.
    share modal on navbar - lets the user share the website on each social media platform. only connects to the website
    at the moment as i need to work out how to get the link to copy.

    
 <h2>Additional features to be implemented in the future:</h2>


    Once further along in this course I plan to add a modal to the images and a carosuel to look trhough them.
    I would like to add hover text as well once I am better equipped to do so.
    will make the share modal actually copy the link for people to share on the different social platforms.

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

To construct my website I used mainly HTML and CSS. I also used:

Bootstrap for the main images galleries to provide a better looking set of images. and also for the share modal.
Font awesome was used for the social links.
google fonts was used for the text on all pages.
I added hover as well but this is still a work in progress and im finding it difficult to get the exact size for the hover overlay
hence why I have it as an aditional feature for the future.

<h1>Testing</h1>

As I have been building this website I have constantly been testing it.  I always check every size of display eg. iphone ipad evrytime I 
added a new feature to make sure that it worked on all devices. Each link item was checked to make sure it goes to the correct site.

    Contact form:
        Go to the "Contact" page
        Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
        Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    Social Link:
        Click on link.
        Check that a new page laods with the relevant link.
    NavBar:
        Click each navigation item.
        Make sure it takes you to the relevant page, try this on every page to make sure you can navigate
         around the entire site.
    Logo:
        Spent some time trying diffrernt logos and decided that it would be better to use 2 different ones for
        the different screen sizes, uesd dev tools to makes sure it would work on the screens.  
    Follow me Button:
        Click button.
        Make sure it takes you to the correct website.   
    Share button in navbar:
        clciked button in every screen size
        made sure the modal fits the screen
        links to the right web oages.
            
    

I came across lots of problems while making this site mainly with the images.  It took a while to get to grips with different 
combinations in bootstrap to get the screen sizes to work responsively.  And also with the navigation bar getting it to center in the screen.
When I first made the navbar it would stick to the right of the screen until i worked out how to use the auto margin on both sides to keep it centered.
I used a media query which I worked out how to use from the mini-project beforehand in the course to make sure the contact form looked good on all devcices.
I'm still struggling to get the image overlay which comes up with text to sit exactly on the images.  Ive had to remove it for the time being.

<h1>Deployment</h1>

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

    Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
    Different configuration files?
    Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
